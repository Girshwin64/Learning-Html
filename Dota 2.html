                <h2>All about dota 2</h2>
                <h3>The game</h3>
                <p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), 
                   which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/timeline/chapter-04">Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</a> and its expansion pack, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/timeline/chapter-05">The Frozen Throne.</a>
                   Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map.
                   Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.
                   During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully battle the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
                   A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called "The Ancient".</p>
